# fitcheck express-api

## Development & Testing Locally

-   First navigate to this folder `fitcheck/express-api` in terminal
-   Install dependencies with `npm install` or `npm i`
-   Start the app with `npm start`
    -   This will call `nodemon api.js --development` to start the backend server in development mode
    -   It will use `nodemon` instead of `node` to keep the script running and restart whenever source files are changed
-   Start the app in production mode with `node api.js --production`
